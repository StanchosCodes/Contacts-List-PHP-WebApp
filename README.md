# Contacts List
This is a PHP Web application serving logic for managing a list of contacts. I created this project to learn the basics of a PHP Web application.

### Pages structure
It has two main pages: One for contacts and one for groups.

### Logic
The user can create, update, delete a contact or add it to a group. The list can be sorted by all available groups.

### Technologies
For database it is used MySQL. The front-end is basic HTML &amp; CSS.
